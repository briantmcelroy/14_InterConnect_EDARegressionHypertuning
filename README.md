# InterConnectChurn

## About this Project

This project is a top-to-bottom demonstration of a classic churn regression task. The phone and internet business InterConnect has expressed an interest in identifying users who are about to end their service. Equipped with this knowledge, InterConnect could then offer incentives and discounts to prevent churn. To accomplish this task, we will build a machine learning model that can profile users and identify likely churn candidates.

We have also included a solution report notebook outlining the project plan, challenges faced, and conclusions of the project. We highly recommend reviewing that notebook to understand how a data scientist may approach a complex regression task from start to finish.

## Running it Yourself

The Jupyter notebook is self-contained and reflects the outputs of the code contained within. If you would like to connect to your own environment and run the notebook, or make changes on your own fork of the repo, you may do so after cloning. Make sure the environment is either based in the upper-level folder to which you clone the repo, or be sure to replace the dataset file references with a direct local reference to the /datasets/ folder on your machine. 

The project relies on scikit-learn 1.5.1. Our lightgbm version was 4.5.0. Our seaborn version was 0.13.2. The project is stable with Python 3.11.
